# Pocketeam API (pocketeam-api)

The Pocketeam API enables users to create Pokémon teams (public or private) using the first 151 Pokémon. It allows users to store their competitive or thematic team ideas. The application is focused on a robust implementation of the Clean Architecture. Swagger documentation is available for exploring the API.

## Installation
